# Log 6: Final Update


## Known bugs/issues

* Jumping
Player suspended in jump animation while being on the edge of a platform resulting in being unable to jump from that spot. This is mostly noticeable on the smallest of platforms but is generally not that noticeable when playing the game fast as intended.
