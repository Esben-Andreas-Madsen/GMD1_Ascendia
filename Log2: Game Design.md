# Game Design Document

## Executive summary

Our game concept is based on an existing game called Icy Tower, which is a 2D platformer about jumping upwards in a castle-like environment.
The genres is something of a Casual Platformer and is targeted towards younger people. It could fit well under the Facebook games tab (A version actually already exists there). Its purpose is to keep alive the simplicity and replayability that Flash games used to have.

Gameplay
- Traverse the Tower (get a good score)
- Combo-meter
- Platforms based on height / floor
- Collectibles / Achievements / Unlockables
- Floor-tracker UI (or on the platforms)
- Speed up (platforms stay for less time)

Mechanics
- Jumping
- Building momentum
- Platforms falling
- Building combo

Game Elements
- The Tower (Level, consists of walls and platforms)
- Platforms
- Main Character (and skins)

We are going to try and re-create the original Icy Tower aswell as include additions.
