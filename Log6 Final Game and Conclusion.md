# Log 6: Final Update


## Known bugs/issues

* Jumping </br>
Player suspended in jump animation while being on the edge of a platform resulting in being unable to jump from that spot. This is mostly noticeable on the smallest of platforms but is generally not that noticeable when playing the game fast as intended. </br>

</br>
* Settings </br>
After entering the game and quitting back to the menu the settings will be locked in the original setup before entering  the game. So in order to change the volume or disable it alltogether, it is necessary to close the game and boot it back up. </br> ![image](https://github.com/Esben-Andreas-Madsen/GMD1_Ascendia/assets/102215807/f3948e05-104d-4a61-83ab-6ccb3315b971)
 </br>

 
* Platform safety </br>

It was intended that every 100th platform should cover from wall to wall in order to create a safety net and also signify a change in the theme layout, however these platforms will appear sometimes ~10 ish platforms earlier and will only cover 80-90% of the actual game arena.
