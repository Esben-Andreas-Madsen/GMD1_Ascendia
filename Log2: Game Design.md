# Game Design Document

## Executive summary

Our game concept is based on an existing game called Icy Tower, which is a 2D platformer about jumping upwards in a castle-like environment.
The genres is something of a Casual Platformer and is targeted towards younger people. It could fit well under the Facebook games tab (A version actually already exists there). Its purpose is to keep alive the simplicity and replayability that Flash games used to have.

Gameplay
- Traverse the Tower (get a good score)
- Combo-meter (Combo increases speed of Player and the overall score)
- Platforms based on height / floor. Every 50th floor will have a platform that stretches from wall to wall and every 100th floor will changes the level design (colour of platforms & background)
- Collectibles / Achievements / Unlockables
- Floor-tracker UI (or on the platforms)
- Speed up (platforms stay for less time)

Mechanics
- Jumping
- Building momentum
- Platforms falling
- Building combo

Game Elements
- The Tower (Level, consists of walls and platforms)
- Platforms
- Main Character (and skins)

We are going by the base of the original Icy Tower aswell as include additions.

Assets
- Music
- Sound effects (jumping, combo, falling, floor milestone, highscore, content unlocked, ui-interaction, floor specific / environmental noises, tower UI changes based on amount of traversed floors e.g every 100 floors)
- 2D
- Character Models for the skins

Milestones

Early Milestones:
- Movement & Game Arena (simplified version of the tower)
- Player + Objects interacting (collision etc)
- Platforms (stationary and hardcoded at first)
- Visible Score (solely based on floors progressed / height of tower reached in first edition)
