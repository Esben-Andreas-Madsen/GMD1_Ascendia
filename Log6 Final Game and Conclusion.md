# Log 6: Final Update


## Known bugs/issues

* Jumping
Player suspended in jump animation while being on the edge of a platform resulting in being unable to jump from that spot. This is mostly noticeable on the smallest of platforms but is generally not that noticeable when playing the game fast as intended. </br>

</br>
* Settings
After entering the game and quitting back to the menu the settings will be locked in the original setup before entering  the game. So in order to change the volume or disable it alltogether, it is necessary to close the game and boot it back up. </br> ![image](https://github.com/Esben-Andreas-Madsen/GMD1_Ascendia/assets/102215807/a142d7f9-1c1e-4781-9bf6-38c8554bbb51) </br>
